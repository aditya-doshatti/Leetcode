1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K
Medium

Given a positive integer K, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N. If there is no such N, return -1.

Note: N may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: K = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
